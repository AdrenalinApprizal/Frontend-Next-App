# Group Info Panel Update - COMPLETED ✅

## Summary

Successfully updated the group-info-panel.tsx to match the friend-info-panel.tsx implementation with a unified "Attachments" section using the proper `GET api/files/group/{groupId}` endpoint.

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ Updated useFiles Hook

- **File**: `/src/hooks/files/useFiles.ts`
- **Change**: Added `getGroupFiles` to the exported methods list
- **Purpose**: Make the `getGroupFiles` function available for use in components

### 2. ✅ Completely Rewrote Group Info Panel

- **File**: `/src/components/chat/group-info-panel.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced separate "Media" and "Files" sections with unified "Attachments" section
  - Updated to use `getGroupFiles(groupId, page, limit)` endpoint instead of separate media/files calls
  - Fixed all TypeScript errors and missing variables
  - Implemented proper attachment loading with `loadAttachments()` and `loadMoreAttachments()` functions
  - Added proper error handling and loading states
  - Implemented unified attachment preview modal with navigation
  - Added proper download handlers for group attachments
  - Fixed all state management and removed duplicate/conflicting code
  - Improved UI consistency with friend-info-panel.tsx pattern

### 3. ✅ Key Features Implemented

- **Unified Attachments**: Single section showing all file types (images, documents, etc.)
- **Proper API Integration**: Uses `GET api/files/group/{groupId}` endpoint
- **Download Functionality**: Proper file download with progress and error handling
- **Preview Modal**: Image preview with navigation between attachments
- **Pagination**: Load more attachments functionality
- **Share Dialog**: File sharing interface (placeholder for future implementation)
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators throughout
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when file service is unavailable

### 4. ✅ Removed Problematic Code

- Cleaned up all the broken modal states (`showMediaModal`, `showFilesModal`, etc.)
- Removed references to non-existent variables (`selectedMedia`, `selectedFile`, etc.)
- Fixed all duplicate function declarations
- Removed incorrectly embedded ChatInput component code

### 5. ✅ Build Verification

- **Status**: ✅ Successful build with no TypeScript errors
- **Files**: All imports and exports correctly resolved
- **Functionality**: All attachment-related features properly implemented

## Technical Details

### API Endpoint Used

```typescript
getGroupFiles(groupId: string, page: number, limit: number)
// Calls: GET /api/proxy/files/group/${groupId}?page=${page}&limit=${limit}
```

### Key Functions Implemented

- `loadAttachments()` - Initial load of group attachments
- `loadMoreAttachments()` - Pagination for more attachments
- `downloadFile(fileId)` - Download individual files
- `openAttachmentPreview()` - Preview attachments in modal
- `navigateAttachment()` - Navigate between attachments in preview
- `showShareDialog()` - File sharing interface

### State Management

- `attachments: AttachmentItem[]` - Unified attachment list
- `isLoading: boolean` - Loading state for initial load
- `isLoadingMore: boolean` - Loading state for pagination
- `pagination: Pagination` - Pagination metadata
- `selectedAttachment: AttachmentItem | null` - Currently selected attachment

## Result

The group-info-panel.tsx now:

1. ✅ Uses unified "Attachments" section instead of separate Media/Files
2. ✅ Properly integrates with `GET api/files/group/{groupId}` endpoint
3. ✅ Has consistent UI/UX with friend-info-panel.tsx
4. ✅ Includes proper download functionality with JavaScript handlers
5. ✅ Builds successfully with no TypeScript errors
6. ✅ Maintains all existing member management functionality

The implementation is now complete and follows the same pattern as the friend-info-panel.tsx for consistency across the application.
